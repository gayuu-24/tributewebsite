        <p class="text-dark"> Savage moved to New York with a letter of recommendation and little money. She initially sought to study under sculptor Solon Borglum but couldn't afford tuition at the School of American Sculpture. Borglum advised her to apply to Cooper Union, a tuition-free school, where she was admitted, beating out 142 male applicants on the waiting list. Due to her exceptional talent, Cooper Union provided her additional financial support for room and board.
