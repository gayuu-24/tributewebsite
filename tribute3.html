 <div>      
 <div class="edu text-start text-light p-2 mb-1">
    <p class="text-dark">Augusta Savage's career was marked by both significant achievements and tremendous challenges. After studying art in Paris, she returned to the United States in 1931, determined to make her mark despite the hardships of the Great Depression. In 1934, she broke new ground by becoming the first African-American artist elected to the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. She soon founded the Savage Studio of Arts and Crafts in Harlem, with financial support from the Carnegie Foundation. 
        The studio served as a vibrant space for artists, fostering talent in a diverse and inclusive environment.</p>

 </div>    

 
 <div class="edu text-start text-light p-2 mb-1">
    <p class="text-dark">In 1937, Savage became the director of the Harlem Community Art Center, where she led an arts program supported by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). However, she faced discrimination in her leadership role. 
        Despite this, her efforts brought art education to a broad audience, and her leadership made her a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="edu text-start text-light p-2 mb-1"> 
    <p class="text-dark">Her most famous commission came in 1939 when she was one of the few African-American artists chosen to create a work for the New York World's Fair.
         She sculpted Lift Every Voice and Sing (also called The Harp), an iconic piece that celebrated the contributions of Black Americans to music. Though her work was lauded and widely admired, financial constraints prevented it from being cast in bronze, and it was destroyed after the fair.
         </p>

 </div>

 <div class="edu text-start text-light p-2 mb-1">
    <p class="text-dark"> Later in life, Savage faced significant financial struggles, which led her to retreat from the art world.
         She moved to Saugerties, New York, where she lived more quietly, working as a laboratory assistant and occasionally teaching and sculpting for friends and tourists. Despite producing fewer works later in life, she remained creatively active, and her legacy continues to be recognized for its lasting impact on American art.

 <p class="side text-center text-light bg-dark p-1 mt-3 ">Teaching</p>  
 <div class="edu text-start text-light p-2 mb-1"> 
    <p class="text-dark">Savage's influence as an educator was arguably as important as her career as an artist. She was a committed mentor to countless young artists, many of whom would go on to achieve national recognition. In 1932, she founded the Savage Studio of Arts and Crafts in Harlem, offering an inclusive space for aspiring artists to develop their skills in painting, drawing, and sculpture. Among her students were Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis, Gwendolyn Knight, and Kenneth B. Clark â€” all of whom would become prominent figures in their respective fields. </p>

 </div>

 <div class="edu text-start text-light p-2 mb-1">  
    <p class="text-dark">In 1937, she took her teaching a step further as the director of the Harlem Community Art Center, where she led art workshops for over 1,500 students. Her dedication to community-centered art education gave people of all ages and abilities access to creative opportunities, often for the first time. She championed diversity in her teaching staff, helping to create a multicultural learning environment in a time of deep racial segregation. </p>

 </div>

 <div class="edu text-start text-light p-2 mb-1">   
    <p class="text-dark">Savage's teaching extended beyond formal settings. Even in her later years in Saugerties, she continued to teach children in summer camps and shared her passion for art with neighbors and visitors. Her role as an educator left a deep and lasting impact on the next generation of artists, and her mentorship helped shape the future of African-American art in the 20th century.
