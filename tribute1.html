      <p class="side text-center text-light bg-dark p-1">Early Life</p> 
      <p class="h6 text-start text-dark p-2">Augusta Christine Fells was born near Jacksonville, Florida, on February 29, 1892, to Edward Fells and Cornelia Murphy.</p>
      <p class="h6 text-start text-dark p-2">Augusta began making figures as a child, mostly small animals out of the natural red clay of her hometown.</p>
      <p class="h6 text-start text-dark p-2">Her father was a poor Methodist minister who strongly opposed his daughter's early interest in art.</p>
      <p class="h6 text-start text-dark p-2">"My father kicked me four or five times a week," Savage once recalled, "and almost whipped all the art out of me."  </p>
      <p class="h6 text-start text-dark p-2">This was because he believed her sculpture to be a sinful practice, due to his interpretation of the "graven images" portion of the Bible.</p>
      <p class="h6 text-start text-dark p-2">She persevered, and the principal of her new high school in West Palm Beach, where her family relocated in 1915, encouraged her talent and allowed her to teach a clay modeling class.</p>
      <p class="h6 text-start text-dark p-2">This began a lifelong commitment to teaching, as well as to creating art.</p>

      <p class="side text-center text-light bg-dark p-1">Personal life</p> 
      <p class="h6 text-start text-dark p-2">In 1907, at the age of 15, Augusta Fells married John T. Moore; they two had a daughter, Irene Connie Moore, who was born the following year, John died shortly thereafter.</p>
      <p class="h6 text-start text-dark p-2">In 1915, after moving to West Palm Beach, she met and married James Savage. </p>
      <p class="h6 text-start text-dark p-2">she retained the name Savage throughout her life, even after the two divorced in the early 1920s. </p>
      <p class="h6 text-start text-dark p-2">In 1923, Savage married Robert Lincoln Poston, a protégé of Marcus Garvey.</p>
      <p class="h6 text-start text-dark p-2">Poston died of pneumonia aboard a ship while returning from Liberia as part of a Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League delegation in 1924.</p>
